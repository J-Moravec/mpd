\value{
nothing, these functions are run for their side-effect
}
\description{
These functions provide a dependency-light alternative to `devtools`.
}
\details{
`test()` install the package and runs tests in the `test` folder, these tests must be created by
some unit-testing framework in that they need to be able to be run outside of `R CMD check`
in the sense that they must report an error if the test fail, as the `Rout.save` snapshot
testing isn't supported when you just run the files in the `test` folder.

The `check()` maps to the `R CMD check` and `document()` runs the `roxygen2::roxygenize`
function to generate documentation.
